                    <h2>Navigating Duality: Marrant's Journey with Identity and Faith</h2>
                    <p>A critical analysis essay written for Dr Jimmy Worthy's English 200 class at UMass Amherst. My analysis explores the duality John Marrant expresses in his book, A Narrative of the Lord's Wonderful Dealings with John Marrant. In conjunction with the phrase "binary opposition", my essay delves into Marrant's relationships with his family, morality, and faith over his spiritual journey.</p>

                    <p>A research essay written for Dr Jimmy Worthy's English 200 class at UMass Amherst. I focused on James Baldwin's manipulation of the stagnance of time in order to delve deeper into the relationship between Sonny and his brother. Additionally, I researched the Cup of Trembling as mentioned in the Bible, exploring the religious connotations of the scene at the nightclub.</p>
