              <p>
                I am currently a freshman in my second semester at the UMass Amherst, studying English. I am thoroughly interested in the ways that language can invoke meaning through emotional, social, and intellectual avenues. I also pay specific attention to writing as an art as opposed to a function; I focus on using words to illustrate complexities while being mindful of flow and aesthetics. I feel that an essential skill I have developed throughout my academic writing career is the ability to convey information in effective ways that remain engaging to the audience. I consistently work to improve my understanding of the English language from a structural standpoint, which is an element of my writing that I am increasingly proud of as I learn and grow as a writer.
