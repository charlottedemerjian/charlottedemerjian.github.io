    <h1>to Know the Author - Charlotte Demerjian</h1>

    <h2> This is my concise bio</h2>
    <p>I am currently a freshman in my second semester at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying English. Over the rest of the year, I would like to explore a potential minor in Linguistics. I am thoroughly interested in the ways that language can invoke meaning emotionally, socially, and intellectually. I also pay specific attention to writing as an art as opposed to a function; using words to illustrate complexities while being mindful of flow. I feel that an essential skill I have developed throughout my academic writing career is the ability to convey information in engaging and aesthetic ways. </p>

    <h2> This is my longer bio </h2>
    <p>	I am currently a freshman in my second semester at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, studying English. Over the rest of the year, I would like to explore a potential minor in Linguistics. I am thoroughly interested in the ways that language can invoke meaning through emotional, social, and intellectual avenues. I also pay specific attention to writing as an art as opposed to a function; I focus on using words to illustrate complexities while being mindful of flow and aesthetics. I feel that an essential skill I have developed throughout my academic writing career is the ability to convey information in effective ways that remain engaging to the audience. I consistently work to improve my understanding of the English language from a structural standpoint, which is an element of my writing that I am increasingly proud of as I learn and grow as a writer. <br>
