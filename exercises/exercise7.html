            <h2>Navigating Duality: Marrant's Journey with Identity and Faith</h2>
            <p>An evaluation of the life of John Marrant, an 18th century preacher and author whose dramatic depiction of his religious journey reflected the desperation of some Black Americans to appeal to white American audiences. 
            Marrant's perception of his own identity reveals uncomfortable truths about the effects of faith on marginalized peoples. When read through the lens of binary opposition, Marrant's contorted view of his religion conveys his fear of the white supremacist powers of 18th century America.</p>
